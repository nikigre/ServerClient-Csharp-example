# ServerClient C# example
In this repository, you will find an example of client-server communication over TCP and UDP protocol. 
This project is a great start for understanding, how TCP/UDP communication works and also, for creating your own server/client programs.
## Remarks
* If non-ASCII characters do not work, the problem is with the method Console.ReadLine() and not with client-server communication. Change command line encoding.
* This is just a simple to understand implementation, and it may not be the most efficient.
* Sorry for the typos in comments ðŸ˜‹
